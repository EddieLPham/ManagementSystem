# Full-Stack Project with APIs

## Project Overview

This project helped me learn essential full-stack development skills by building and consuming APIs with modern technologies.
I created a fully functional application using ReactJS for the front-end, ExpressJS and Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database.

# Project Summary: Management System for Users, Providers, and Appointments

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop a management system that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users,
providers, and appointments. The system will also allow users to assign appointments to specific providers and manage the pricing for those appointments.

---

## Key Features

- **User and Provider Management**:

  - Users can be created, updated, and deleted.
  - Providers can be added, modified, or removed from the system.

- **Appointment Scheduling**:

  - Users can schedule appointments with providers.
  - Appointments will include pricing information for services rendered.

- **Connecting Appointments with Providers**:
  - Each appointment will be connected to a specific provider, ensuring accurate scheduling and service delivery.

## Purpose and Outcome

The goal of the project is to streamline appointment scheduling, manage provider availability,
and allow users to maintain detailed records of appointments with corresponding prices.
This system ensures better organization and efficiency in handling user and provider interactions.
