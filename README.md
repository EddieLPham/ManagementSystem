# Full-Stack Project with APIs

## Project Overview

This project helped me learn essential full-stack development skills by building and consuming APIs with modern technologies.
I created a fully functional application using ReactJS for the front-end, ExpressJS and Node.js for the back-end, and MongoDB for the database.

## Key Objectives

### 1. Learn API Development

- Build RESTful APIs using ExpressJS.
- Understand CRUD operations and handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### 2. Master Front-End Development

- Use ReactJS to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- Integrate APIs to fetch and display data in real-time.

### 3. Implement Back-End Functionality

- Set up a Node.js server with ExpressJS.
- Use Nodemon to enable live server updates during development.

### 4. Database Integration with MongoDB

- Design and connect a MongoDB database.
- Perform data operations like storing, retrieving, and updating records.

### 5. Full-Stack Workflow

- Connect the front-end, back-end, and database seamlessly.
- Handle API requests and responses efficiently.
